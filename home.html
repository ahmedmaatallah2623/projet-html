    <h1 class="home1">History of HTML</h1>
    <p>
      HTML was first invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993, though the language
      was not widely used until 1999, when HTML 4.01 became an official standard
      for web development. In 2012, the language was updated into HTML5, which
      offered expanded capabilities. Interestingly, modern HTML codebases tend
      to be shorter than early ones. Many of the design and interactive elements
      that developers used to code manually are now handled with CSS (Cascading
      Style Sheets) or JavaScript.

    <h1 class="home1">Why Learn HTML?</h1>
    <p>
      HTML, which stands for “Hypertext Markup Language,” is the language used
      to create, structure and design websites. The term “hypertext” refers to
      HTML’s ability to link out to relevant content. As a markup language, tags
      are used in HTML to define the overall structure and layout of a webpage,
      as well as the content elements within it. At its most fundamental level —
      before extra styling and dynamic elements are applied — HTML tags tell
      your web browser what to display on the screen and in what order. When
      coding for the web, you wrap or enclose different parts of your content to
      ensure that it appears where, when and how you want. Basic HTML tags can
      determine font size as well as basic formatting choices such as bold or
      italics. While the kind of content, design and dynamism that we see on the
      web has changed dramatically over the past few decades, HTML has remained
      the fundamental framework that powers web design. Even dynamic websites
      generated by more advanced scripting languages such as Javascript or PHP
      rely at least in part on HTML. This is why learning to code in HTML
      continues to be essential for web developers.
